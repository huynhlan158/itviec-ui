HEADER:
- menu items: =======================> OK 
    - grid?
    - "View all job by..."
- input search: the text color of placeholder is not right =======================> OK (set opacity = 1 for ::placeholder)

COMPANY OVERVIEW (1/ bottom of job overview, 2/ top of company profile, 3/ right side of job page):
- reuse? =======================> OK 

CHARACTERISTICITEM:
- get icons from official website?

JOBLIST:
- scroll behavior to bottom =======================> OK (set height to fit the screen)
- 1st click to jobItem (affected by a callback which is setState (useState) in useEffect): component re-render 2 times?

JOBITEM:
- job-title: margin-bottom does not work =======================> OK (set display block/flex)

PAGINATION:
- optimize logic?

GLOBALSTORE:
- structure for multiple state?
- jobList vs recommendedJobList
- use memo to avoid components re-render when state changes: does not work with headerShrink

FILTERJOBS:
- optimize logic?

COMMON: 
- data structure's rules?
- check the existence before processing data (data is undefined before calling apis causes error: "Cannot read properties of undefined ")
- components' separation is reasonable?
- tippyjs: hideOnClick does not work
